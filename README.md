## Description

The primary goal of this project was to creat a gallery of pictures that included:

- Creating a like button which held the value of total times it was clicked
- Creating a toggle between the picture and the descrpition
- Succesffully displaying images/descrption on the DOM

My major takeaway from this project is to save your work constantly! This was my 2nd attempt due to not committing enough.
